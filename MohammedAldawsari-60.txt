Setup:

run these commands before you start the lab:

[10/03/23]seed@VM:~$ sudo mkdir -p ~/mydir/mydir2
[10/03/23]seed@VM:~$ sudo touch ~/mydir/mydir2/yourname.txt
[10/03/23]seed@VM:~$ cp /var/log/anaconda/syslog ~/mydir/securecopy.txt
cp: cannot stat '/var/log/anaconda/syslog': No such file or directory

to solve the problem ==>

[10/03/23]seed@VM:~$ echo "This is a sample log for testing purposes." | sudo tee ~/mydir/samplelog.txt > /dev/null

[10/03/23]seed@VM:~$ sudo cp ~/mydir/samplelog.txt ~/mydir/securecopy.txt



------cksum securecopy.txt and save the output as screen shot.-------------------

[10/03/23]seed@VM:~$ cd ~/mydir
[10/03/23]seed@VM:~/mydir$ cksum securecopy.txt

---------------Use man page with the "useradd" command and save the output in "useradd-man.txt" using what you have learned in "stdin/stdout" lesson, then grep the word "password" from the "useradd-man.txt" you have created and take a screen shot for the grep output.--------------------------
